                  CalDAV: Auditing Status and Feedback
                            caldav-audit-00

Abstract

   This document defines an extension to CalDAV that allows clients and
   servers that audit data on the server, to provide feedback based on
   the results of such audits.  This can be used to signal clients about
   junk events, or other inappropriate content.  It can also be used by
   clients to provide feedback about junk events, or other inappropriate
   content, that the server can act on in a manner that prevents the
   originator of the data from knowing it was discarded.

1.  Introduction

   Internet calendaring and scheduling standards are defined by
   iCalendar [RFC5545] and iTIP [RFC5546].  The CalDAV Access [RFC4791]
   standard defines a way to access calendar data stored on a server,
   and the CalDAV Scheduling [RFC6638] draft defines how scheduling
   occurs between users of a CalDAV server.

   CalDAV calendar users can receive event invitations or sharing
   invitations from other users on the CalDAV server, and in the case of
   event invitations, they may also be received from users outside the
   system (e.g., via an email based gateway service).  Unfortunately, as

   has been the case with email for quite some time now, this provides
   an avenue for abuse.  In particular, there has recently been an
   increase in so called calendar "spam" (unsolicited bulk event
   invitations - in future referred to as "junk" invitations) that
   automatically appear on a user's calendar.  Whilst users can delete
   such invitations, the current default behavior of CalDAV servers is
   to send a scheduling iTIP reply message back to the organizer of the
   invite indicating that the user (who appears as an attendee in the
   invite) has declined the invitation.  This is not desirable as it
   signals to the originator that a speculative attendee calendar user
   address they might have used is in fact valid.  It is much more
   preferable for the invite to be silently discarded without a reply
   being sent.  CalDAV does support such an option via use of the
   "Schedule-Reply" HTTP header (see Section 8.1 of [RFC6638]), however,
   it would be useful to provide an explicit indication from the user to
   the server that a particular invitation is considered inappropriate
   so that the server can use that information to potentially filter
   future invitations that are similar.  This type of feedback has been
   used successfully in email systems, typically exposed to users as a
   "report as junk" option in their email clients.

   Also, as with email, a server can scan invitations as they are being
   delivered and provide an indication of "junk" status to allow clients
   to filter invitations or provide warnings to the user.  Such status
   is usually conveyed in email messages via the addition of email
   message headers during delivery, however, iCalendar invitations
   typically do not include delivery meta-data.

   This specification defines the following extensions to CalDAV to help
   provide better junk invitation status and reporting:

      A new CS:audit-status WebDAV property is defined for use on any
      resource in a CalDAV server.  The value of that property is a
      comma-separated list of "key=value" pairs that can be used to
      convey invitation auditing status from the server to a client.

      A new POST request action can be targeted at resources to allow a
      client to report a problem about the resource and trigger the
      server to take appropriate steps (e.g., discard the resource,
      record information about the resource so that it can be
      permanently suppressed).

   This specification does not cover how servers or clients analyse
   invitations, but rather it only covers the reporting of such
   analysis.  What is considered inappropriate is likely dependent on
   local policies and regulations, which cannot be generally codified.
   It is expected that email scanning tools and techniques can be
   adapted for use with calendar data on both clients and servers.

2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   When XML element types in the namespaces "DAV:" and
   "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:caldav" are referenced in this document
   outside of the context of an XML fragment, the string "DAV:" and
   "CALDAV:" will be prefixed to the element type names respectively.

   The namespace "http://calendarserver.org/ns/" is used for XML
   elements defined in this specification.  When XML element types in
   this namespace are referenced in this document outside of the context
   of an XML fragment, the string "CS:" will be prefixed to the element
   type names respectively.

3.  Server Advertised Capability

   A server that supports this specification MUST include "calendar-
   audit" as a field in the DAV response header field from an OPTIONS
   request on a calendar home collection (see Section 6.2.1 of
   [RFC4791]).  Clients MUST check for the presence of that field in the
   DAV response header field before supporting the extensions in this
   specification.

4.  Audit WebDAV Property

   The CS:audit-status WebDAV property provides any server side audit
   results, for the resource the property is present on, to the client.
   The value of this property is a string containing one or more comma-
   separated "key=value" pairs that can be used to conveying specific
   details about the audit results.  A set of initial keys defined by
   this specification are listed below.  Additional keys may be added in
   the future.  Servers SHOULD only include audit results that are known
   to be useful to clients to avoid having this property grow too large.

   Clients that support this extension SHOULD request the CS:audit-
   status property in any PROPFIND or REPORT requests that return
   properties for resources on the CalDAV server.  In particular,
   calendar object resources will likely all be audited, and so SHOULD
   be checked by clients.

   Clients MAY do their own auditing of resources retrieved from the
   server.  Clients are likely to take into consideration locally
   available contextual information when doing client-side auditing,
   information that is typically not available to servers.  As a result,
   when the CS:audit-status property is present, clients SHOULD use it

   in conjunction with, rather than as a replacement of, any client-side
   auditing to determine the overall suitability of the resource.

4.1.  CS:audit-status

   Name:  audit-status

   Namespace:  http://calendarserver.org/ns/

   Purpose:  Indicates server auditing status for the resource on which
      this property is defined.

   Conformance:  This property MAY be present on any resource within a
      CalDAV calendar home collection.  If present, it SHOULD NOT be
      returned by a PROPFIND DAV:allprop request (as defined in
      Section 14.2 of [RFC4918]).  This is a protected property (as
      defined in Section 15 of [RFC4918]).  This property MUST be
      preserved when the resource is copied or moved.

   Description:  The CS:audit-status property provides details of any
      server auditing done for the resource on which it is defined.  In
      the absence of this property, clients MUST assume that no auditing
      has taken place.  The supported key/value pairs defined in this
      specification are listed in the next section.

   Definition:

   <!ELEMENT audit-status CDATA>
   CDATA is a string using the "audit-status" format defined below

   audit-status = audit-state *("," audit-state)
   audit-state  = audit-key "=" audit-value
   audit-key    = token
   audit-value  = token / quoted-string

   token = ALPHA *(ALPHA / DIGIT / "-")
   quoted-string = DQUOTE *QSAFE-CHAR DQUOTE

   QSAFE-CHAR    = WSP / %x21 / %x23-7E / NON-US-ASCII
   ; Any character except CONTROL and DQUOTE

   NON-US-ASCII  = UTF8-2 / UTF8-3 / UTF8-4
   ; UTF8-2, UTF8-3, and UTF8-4 are defined in [RFC3629]

   CONTROL       = %x00-08 / %x0A-1F / %x7F
   ; All the controls except HTAB

   Note that additional line breaks have been added for readability.

       xmlns:CS="http://calendarserver.org/ns/">
       status=GOOD,audit-id=51CAA5F8-5C48-45E1-B0E7-3534D7254060
   </CS:audit-status>

4.2.  Audit Status Items

   The following CS:audit-status key/value pair items are defined by
   this specification.  The "status" MUST be present, other keys are
   OPTIONAL.  Clients SHOULD ignore any keys that they do not recognize.

   +--------+---------+------------------------------------------------+
   | Key    | Value   | Description                                    |
   +--------+---------+------------------------------------------------+
   | status | GOOD    | Audit result indicates no problem with this    |
   |        |         | resource                                       |
   | status | WARNING | Audit result indicates a possible problem with |
   |        |         | this resource                                  |
   | status | BAD     | Audit result indicates a strong possibility of |
   |        |         | a problem with this resource                   |
   +--------+---------+------------------------------------------------+

   +----------+-----------+--------------------------------------------+
   | Key      | Value     | Description                                |
   +----------+-----------+--------------------------------------------+
   | score    | {integer: | An integer value in the range 0-100. 0     |
   |          | 0-100}    | means the resource  is definitely free of  |
   |          |           | problematic content. 100 means the         |
   |          |           | resource definitely contains problematic   |
   |          |           | content. Values in between relate to       |
   |          |           | varying degrees of concern for the         |
   |          |           | resource content.                          |
   | reason   | {string}  | A textual description of the result of the |
   |          |           | server audit that can be presented to the  |
   |          |           | user.                                      |
   | audit-id | {string}  | An opaque identifier used to correlate the |
   |          |           | reported audit status with the auditing    |
   |          |           | system.                                    |
   +----------+-----------+--------------------------------------------+

5.  Client Audit Reporting

   When a client detects a CalDAV resource that it has determined to be
   inappropriate for some reason, or as the result of the calendar user
   explicitly indicating that a resource is inappropriate, it can signal
   that state to the server by issuing a POST request with the request-



Daboo                    Expires August 25, 2018                [Page 5]

                             CalDAV Auditing               February 2018


   URI set to the resource URI, and with an "action=audit-failure" query
   parameter in the request-URI.

   Upon receiving such a request the server MUST take the following
   actions:

   a.  If the target resource is a calendar object resource, the server
       MUST delete the resource without sending any scheduling reply
       messages.  The server MUST use the iCalendar UID property value
       in the target resource to:

       1.  delete any other resources in calendar collections owned by
           the calendar user, or the calendar user's scheduling inbox
           collection, that have the same iCalendar UID property

       2.  prevent any future scheduling messages with the same
           iCalendar UID being delivered to that calendar user

   b.  If the target resource is a sharing invitation in the calendar
       user's notification collection, the server MUST delete the
       notification resource without sending any sharing reply to the
       sharer.  The server MUST also prevent any future sharing
       invitations for the same calendar collection from being delivered
       to the calendar user.

   c.  The behavior for other types of resource is currently undefined.
       Servers MUST reject such requests with an appropriate HTTP 4xx
       status code

   Servers MAY perform their own analysis of the resource being reported
   and act on it accordingly, but this specification does not define how
   that is done or what the consequences are.

   The audit report POST request supports the following request-URI
   query parameters:

   +--------+----------------------------------------------------------+
   | Name   | Description                                              |
   +--------+----------------------------------------------------------+
   | action | this is REQUIRED and MUST have a value of "audit-        |
   |        | failure"                                                 |
   | reason | this is OPTIONAL and contains a short string indicating  |
   |        | the nature of the failure                                |
   +--------+----------------------------------------------------------+

   The client MAY include other query parameters as needed.  The server
   SHOULD ignore all query parameters that it cannot process.

                             CalDAV Auditing               February 2018


   On successful completion of the request, the server returns an
   appropriate HTTP 2xx status code.  Upon receiving a successful
   response, clients SHOULD immediately re-synchronize their state with
   the server to ensure any resources that were removed as a result of
   the POST request are also removed from any cache the client might
   have.

   If the request fails for any reason, the actions described above MUST
   NOT occur, and in particular, no resources are to be deleted.

   This specification discards an entire resource - thus there is no
   provision to report inappropriate content in one instance of a
   recurring event since all instances are in the same calendar object
   resource.

5.1.  Example

   The client issues a POST request to indicate an audit failure on a
   particular resource:

   >> Request <<

   POST /event.ics?action=audit-failure&reason=junk HTTP/1.1
   Host: cal.example.com
   Content-Length: 0

   >> Response <<

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Date: Fri, 10 Jan 2017 14:02:20 GMT
   Content-Type: text/plain
   Content-Length: xxxx

   Report received and acted upon.

6.  Security Considerations

   It is important that no replies whatsoever be sent back to the
   originator of the invitation being discarded.  In addition, the
   invite originator MUST NOT be given any other indication that the
   invite was discarded.

   The server MUST protect any information it gets from client audit
   failure reports to prevent attackers from learning how to work around
   client auditing procedures.

7.  Privacy Considerations

   The server MUST protect any information it gets from client audit
   failure reports to prevent calendar users from being "profiled" based
   on what items they consider to be inappropriate.

8.  IANA Considerations

   None.

Appendix B.  Change History

   Changes 2016-12-09

   1.  Clarify that clients should never totally rely on the server
       audit-status result, but instead should always do their own
       auditing and use the server status as input to that.

   2.  Fix xmlns value used in examples.

   3.  Remove reference to client reporting on the inbox scheduling
       resource.

   4.  Indicate that servers can implement their own procedures for
       analyzing invites reported by the client - but those are out of
       scope of this spec.
