    - description: |
        Clarify that clients should never totally rely on the server audit-status result, but instead should always do their own auditing and use the server status as input to that.

        Fix xmlns value used in examples.

        Remove reference to client reporting on the inbox scheduling resource.

        Indicate that servers can implement their own procedures for analyzing invites reported by the client - but those are out of scope of this spec.
