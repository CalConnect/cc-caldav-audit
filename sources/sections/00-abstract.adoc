This document defines an extension to CalDAV that allows clients and
servers that audit data on the server, to provide feedback based on
the results of such audits. This can be used to signal clients about
junk events, or other inappropriate content. It can also be used by
clients to provide feedback about junk events, or other inappropriate
content, that the server can act on in a manner that prevents the
originator of the data from knowing it was discarded.
