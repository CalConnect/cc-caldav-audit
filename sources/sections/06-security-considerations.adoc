== Security Considerations

It is important that no replies whatsoever be sent back to the
originator of the invitation being discarded. In addition, the
invite originator `MUST NOT` be given any other indication that the
invite was discarded.

The server `MUST` protect any information it gets from client audit
failure reports to prevent attackers from learning how to work around
client auditing procedures.
