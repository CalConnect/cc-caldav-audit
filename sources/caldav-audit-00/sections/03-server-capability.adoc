== Server Advertised Capability

A server that supports this specification `MUST` include
"`calendar-audit`" as a field in the `DAV` response header field from an `OPTIONS`
request on a calendar home collection (see
<<RFC4791,section=6.2.1>>).
Clients `MUST` check for the presence of that field in the
`DAV` response header field before supporting the extensions in this
specification.
